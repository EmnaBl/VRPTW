The project was realized for the course Optimization Methods and algorithms by Roberto Tadei.
The basic program was already provided, the purpose of the project was optimizing the code provided 
in a specific case (VRPTW problem). In this folder there is the project optimized, a simple relation very
synthetic. The part concerned the Genetic Algorithm and the Tab√π Search was written or modified by me.
